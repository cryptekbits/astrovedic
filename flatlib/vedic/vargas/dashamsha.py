    Calculate the D10 (Dashamsha) longitude
    
    In the Dashamsha chart, each sign is divided into ten parts of 3Â° each.
    The resulting sign depends on the original sign:
    
    For odd signs (Aries, Gemini, etc.):
        The ten divisions map to the 9th sign from the birth sign and the next nine signs in order
        
    For even signs (Taurus, Cancer, etc.):
        The ten divisions map to the 3rd sign from the birth sign and the next nine signs in order
    
    Args:
        longitude (float): The longitude in the birth chart (0-360)
    
    Returns:
        float: The longitude in the D10 chart
