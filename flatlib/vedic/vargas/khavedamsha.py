    Calculate the D40 (Khavedamsha) longitude
    
    In the Khavedamsha chart, each sign is divided into forty parts of 0.75Â° each.
    The resulting sign depends on the original sign:
    
    For movable signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn):
        The forty divisions map to the twelve signs starting from Aries, then the twelve signs starting from Aries again, 
        then the twelve signs starting from Aries again, and finally the four signs starting from Aries
        
    For fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius):
        The forty divisions map to the twelve signs starting from Leo, then the twelve signs starting from Leo again, 
        then the twelve signs starting from Leo again, and finally the four signs starting from Leo
        
    For dual signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces):
        The forty divisions map to the twelve signs starting from Sagittarius, then the twelve signs starting from Sagittarius again, 
        then the twelve signs starting from Sagittarius again, and finally the four signs starting from Sagittarius
    
    Args:
        longitude (float): The longitude in the birth chart (0-360)
    
    Returns:
        float: The longitude in the D40 chart
