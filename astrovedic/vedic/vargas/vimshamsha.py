    Calculate the D20 (Vimshamsha) longitude
    
    In the Vimshamsha chart, each sign is divided into twenty parts of 1.5Â° each.
    The resulting sign depends on the original sign:
    
    For movable signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn):
        The twenty divisions map to Aries through Virgo, then Libra through Pisces, then Aries through Scorpio
        
    For fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius):
        The twenty divisions map to Leo through Pisces, then Aries through Pisces, then Aries
        
    For dual signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces):
        The twenty divisions map to Sagittarius through Pisces, then Aries through Pisces, then Aries through Gemini
    
    Args:
        longitude (float): The longitude in the birth chart (0-360)
    
    Returns:
        float: The longitude in the D20 chart
