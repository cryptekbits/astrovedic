    Calculate the D7 (Saptamsha) longitude
    
    In the Saptamsha chart, each sign is divided into seven parts of 4.2857Â° each.
    The resulting sign depends on the original sign:
    
    For odd signs (Aries, Gemini, etc.):
        The seven divisions map to the same sign and the next six signs in order
        
    For even signs (Taurus, Cancer, etc.):
        The seven divisions map to the 7th sign from the birth sign and the next six signs in order
    
    Args:
        longitude (float): The longitude in the birth chart (0-360)
    
    Returns:
        float: The longitude in the D7 chart
