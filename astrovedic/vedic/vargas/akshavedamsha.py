    Calculate the D45 (Akshavedamsha) longitude
    
    In the Akshavedamsha chart, each sign is divided into forty-five parts of 0.67Â° each.
    The resulting sign depends on the original sign:
    
    For movable signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn):
        The forty-five divisions map to the nine signs starting from Aries, then the nine signs starting from Aries again, 
        then the nine signs starting from Aries again, then the nine signs starting from Aries again, 
        and finally the nine signs starting from Aries again
        
    For fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius):
        The forty-five divisions map to the nine signs starting from Leo, then the nine signs starting from Leo again, 
        then the nine signs starting from Leo again, then the nine signs starting from Leo again, 
        and finally the nine signs starting from Leo again
        
    For dual signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces):
        The forty-five divisions map to the nine signs starting from Sagittarius, then the nine signs starting from Sagittarius again, 
        then the nine signs starting from Sagittarius again, then the nine signs starting from Sagittarius again, 
        and finally the nine signs starting from Sagittarius again
    
    Args:

        float: The longitude in the D45 chart
