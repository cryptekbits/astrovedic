    Calculate the D24 (Chaturvimshamsha) longitude
    
    In the Chaturvimshamsha chart, each sign is divided into twenty-four parts of 1.25Â° each.
    The resulting sign depends on the original sign:
    
    For movable signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn):
        The twenty-four divisions map to the twelve signs starting from Aries, then the twelve signs starting from Aries again
        
    For fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius):
        The twenty-four divisions map to the twelve signs starting from Leo, then the twelve signs starting from Leo again
        
    For dual signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces):
        The twenty-four divisions map to the twelve signs starting from Sagittarius, then the twelve signs starting from Sagittarius again
    
    Args:
        longitude (float): The longitude in the birth chart (0-360)
    
    Returns:
        float: The longitude in the D24 chart
