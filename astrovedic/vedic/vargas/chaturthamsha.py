    Calculate the D4 (Chaturthamsha) longitude
    
    In the Chaturthamsha chart, each sign is divided into four parts of 7.5Â° each.
    The resulting sign depends on the original sign and the quarter:
    
    For movable signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn):
        1st quarter: Same sign
        2nd quarter: 4th sign from birth sign
        3rd quarter: 7th sign from birth sign
        4th quarter: 10th sign from birth sign
        
    For fixed signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius):
        1st quarter: 11th sign from birth sign
        2nd quarter: 2nd sign from birth sign
        3rd quarter: 5th sign from birth sign
        4th quarter: 8th sign from birth sign
        
    For dual signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces):
        1st quarter: 9th sign from birth sign
        2nd quarter: 12th sign from birth sign
        3rd quarter: 3rd sign from birth sign
        4th quarter: 6th sign from birth sign
    
    Args:
        longitude (float): The longitude in the birth chart (0-360)
    
    Returns:
        float: The longitude in the D4 chart
