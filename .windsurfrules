      ...
   ```

4. **Comprehensive Implementation and Verification**
   - Execute file operations and related processes in optimized complete sequences
   - Continuously verify against quality standards throughout implementation
   - Address issues promptly with integrated solutions
   - Execute processes only within the scope of instructions, without adding extra features or operations

5. **Continuous Feedback**
   - Regularly report implementation progress
   - Confirm at critical decision points
   - Promptly report issues with proposed solutions

6. **Research and Domain Knowledge**
   - Search the internet for subject matter insights when needed
   - Research astrological concepts and calculations for accuracy
   - Verify implementations against authoritative sources
   - Consult reference materials for domain-specific knowledge
   - Document sources of information in code comments

## Implementation Process
### 1. Initial Analysis Phase
```markdown
### Requirements Analysis
- Identify functional requirements
- Confirm technical constraints
- Check consistency with existing code
### Domain Research
- Research astrological concepts and calculations
- Search for authoritative sources and references
- Understand mathematical foundations of calculations
### Risk Assessment
- Potential technical challenges
- Accuracy and correctness impacts
- Security considerations
```
### 2. Implementation Phase
- Iterative implementation approach
- Continuous verification with tests
- Maintenance of code quality and PEP 8 compliance
### 3. Verification Phase
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Correctness verification with reference data
### 4. Final Confirmation
- Consistency with requirements
- Code quality and documentation
- Test coverage completeness

## Error Handling Protocol
1. **Problem Identification**
   - Error message analysis
   - Impact scope identification
   - Root cause isolation through debugging
2. **Solution Development**
   - Evaluation of multiple approaches
   - Compatibility assessment with existing code
   - Optimal solution selection
3. **Implementation and Verification**
   - Solution implementation
   - Verification through comprehensive testing
   - Regression testing to ensure no side effects
4. **Documentation**
   - Document exceptions and error handling in docstrings
   - Add appropriate error messages and logging
   - Update tests to cover error cases

I will follow these instructions to deliver high-quality implementations. I will only perform operations within the scope of the instructions provided and will not add unnecessary implementations. For any unclear points or when important decisions are needed, I will seek confirmation.

## Development Workflow Guidelines

### Initial Setup
1. Before starting work on a new feature:
   - Run the test suite: `./run_tests.py`
   - Verify all tests pass before proceeding
   - Check for uncommitted Python code and commit using the format below
   - Only then begin new development

### Development Process
1. Follow an iterative development approach:
   - Break down features into smaller, manageable tasks
   - Implement one component at a time
   - Test each component as you build it
   - Refactor and optimize before moving to the next component

2. When reaching a critical/major development stage:
   - Write comprehensive tests following docs/test_creation_guidelines.md
   - Include proper test metadata in tests/test_metadata.json
   - Run the test suite to verify everything passes
   - Update README.md and other documentation as needed
   - Commit your changes using the format below

### Code Organization
1. Keep files concise and focused:
   - No file should exceed 600-700 lines of code
   - Split large implementations into multiple files
   - Create dedicated directories/packages for complex functionality

2. Plan ahead for complex features:
   - Before implementation, design a logical class structure
   - Organize related functionality into cohesive classes
   - Place related classes in a dedicated package/directory
   - Use clear naming conventions for better maintainability

### Commit Message Format
When committing code changes, follow this changelog-style format:

1. Use a structured header: type(scope): concise title
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Scope: area affected (e.g., core, testing, vedic)

2. Follow with a bulleted list of specific changes:
   - Each bullet should start with an action verb
   - Be specific about what was changed
   - Group related changes in the same commit
   - Include implementation details when relevant

Example:
feat(testing): implement comprehensive test suite infrastructure
- Create robust test suite framework in scripts/test.py
- Add run_tests.py wrapper script for easy test execution
- Implement detailed HTML report generation with charts
- Support command-line options for flexible test execution

### Testing Requirements
1. All new features must include tests
2. Tests must follow the structure in docs/test_creation_guidelines.md
3. Add test metadata to tests/test_metadata.json
4. Run the full test suite before committing: `./run_tests.py`
5. Fix any failing tests before proceeding
6. Focus on correctness and accuracy verification
7. Include tests for edge cases and error handling

### Documentation Requirements
1. Update README.md with any user-facing changes
2. Document new features, APIs, and configuration options
3. Include examples for significant new functionality
4. Update any affected existing documentation
5. Add proper docstrings to all public functions and classes
6. Include type hints for better IDE support
7. Document package structure for PyPI distribution

### PyPI Packaging Guidelines
1. Maintain proper package structure for PyPI distribution
2. Keep setup.py and requirements.txt updated
3. Use semantic versioning for releases
4. Include all necessary metadata in package configuration
5. Ensure backward compatibility when possible
6. Document breaking changes clearly in release notes
